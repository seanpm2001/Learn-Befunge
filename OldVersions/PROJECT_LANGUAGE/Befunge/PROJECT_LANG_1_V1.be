>"I decided to make Befunge the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Befunge) as Befunge is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Befunge programming language. It only makes sense to Befunge the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.",,,,,,,,,,,@
